# Fitness (Un)Wrapped

Your Fitness (Garmin/Strava/StrideSync) (un)Wrappred, free from paywalls

Welcome! I'm making this repo public to be 100% transparent that this app is client-side only and does not collect or store any user data. All data processing happens locally in the browser.

This is in early development. The following data sources are supported:

- **activities.csv** (recommended) - Complete export from Garmin Account Data Management
- **Total Distance.csv** from Garmin Connect
- **Steps.csv** from Garmin Connect

The app automatically detects and processes your data. For activities.csv, swimming distances are automatically converted from meters to kilometers.

## Contributing

- Adding more sport-customized slides

- Adding graphics to existing cards
- Adding new slide types and visualizations
- Support more languages
